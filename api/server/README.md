# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote
server, you can easily generate a server stub. This is an example of building a Swagger-enabled
Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
pip3 install 'connexion[swagger-ui]'  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/57207557/5601796
python3 -m swagger_server
```

Then open the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/apis/v1alpha1/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/apis/v1alpha1/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
