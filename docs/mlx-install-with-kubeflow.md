## Install Kfctl

**Note**: kfctl is currently available for Linux and macOS users only. If you use Windows, you can install kfctl on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the official [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for setting up WSL.

Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow:

1. Download the latest kfctl {{% kf-latest-version %}} release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/{{% kf-latest-version %}}).
  
  **Note**: You're strongly recommended to install **kfctl v1.2** or above because kfctl v1.2 addresses several critical bugs that can break the Kubeflow deployment.

2. Extract the archived TAR file:

      ```shell
      tar -xvf kfctl_{{% kf-latest-version %}}_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
3. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.

      ```shell
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```


## Deploy MLX

1. Now you can apply MLX [_KfDef_](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/distributions/operator/introduction/#kubeflow-operator) custom resource on Kubernetes to deploy MLX.

2. For IKS / Minikube use the following KFDEF
    ```shell
    export KFDEF_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machine-learning-exchange/manifests/mlx/kfdef/kfctl_ibm_tekton.yaml
    ```

    **OR**

    For Openshift we need to set the proper scc. Use the following KFDEF
    ```shell
    export KFDEF_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machine-learning-exchange/manifests/mlx/kfdef/kfctl_mlx_openshift_tekton.yaml
    ```

3. Download the KFDEF to local:
    ```shell
    export KFDEF=$(echo "${KFDEF_URL}" | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)
    curl -L ${KFDEF_URL} > ${KFDEF}
    ```

4. Use `kfctl` to deploy MLX
    ```shell
    kfctl apply -V -f ${KFDEF}
    ```
