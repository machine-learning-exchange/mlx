# Datasets

MLX datasets are reusable datasets that leverage [Datashim](https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim)
for providing data volume to all the other MLX assets.

The dataset definition is based on the [DAX metadata](https://github.com/CODAIT/exchange-metadata-converter)
and it is still evolving with the latest Datashim requirements.
You can visit [exchange-metadata-converter](https://github.com/CODAIT/exchange-metadata-converter)
to understand how the DAX metadata is defined and being converted to the Datashim metadata format.

## Create Dataset Metadata

See the [template](#dataset-metadata-template) below to create the metadata for a dataset. Take a look at these
[samples](https://github.com/CODAIT/exchange-metadata-converter/tree/main/dax-data-set-descriptors)
or the original [template](https://github.com/CODAIT/exchange-metadata-converter/blob/main/dax-data-set-descriptors/lorem_ipsum.yaml)
to better understand the dataset metadata spec.

## Register Datasets

1. Click on the "Dataset" link in left-hand navigation panel
2. Click on "Upload a Dataset"
3. Select a file to upload (Must be `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` format)
    * This will be the compressed `.yaml` specification
4. Enter a name for the dataset; Otherwise the `name` from the `.yaml` spec will be used

## Use Dataset with MLX Assets

Asset integration is work in progress. You can take a look at the
[JFK Airport Temperature Prediction Model notebook](/notebooks/dlf-notebooks/JFK_Data.ipynb)
