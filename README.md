# Machine Learning eXchange (MLX)

**Data and AI Assets Catalog** 

Allows registration and search of Data and AI Assets:
 - AI pipelines and pipeline operators
 - Models
 - Datasets
 - Notebooks
 - Any other asset type by just specifying a JSON-Schema

This is Version 2 of MLX. MLX comes with its own backend but
integrations to HugginFace and other catalogs are on the roadmap.
